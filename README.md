# Alpine VNC with Wireshark

A lightweight (480 MB) personal Linux workstation based on [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org). Provides VNC and SSH services, and Wireshark pre-installed.

This repo is based on Ramon Slano's image available at: https://github.com/rwildcat/docker_alpine-vnc

I've modified it to add the Wireshark package.  This image is intended for use in demonstrating running a Docker container on a Cisco Catalyst 9300 switch.

Instructions for this are available here: https://ccie.tv/deploying-docker-containers-to-a-cisco-catalyst-9300/

**DO NOT USER THIS CONTAINER IN A PRODUCTION NETWORK**
